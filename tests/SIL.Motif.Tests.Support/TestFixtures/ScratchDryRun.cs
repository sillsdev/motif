/// Tests used to call <c>ProposalDryRunner.Run(_cache, proposal)</c> against their own cache, which was
/// safe only because Run rolled back — and that rollback was the thing that left LibLCM's derived caches
/// stale. Now Run demands a <see cref="DryRunScratch"/> and never reverts it, so a test that wants both
/// a Dry Run and a subsequent Apply against the same project needs the two to happen on different
/// caches. This helper is that, and it is deliberately the same three steps production performs rather
/// than a shortcut, so the tests exercise the real sequence.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why it saves first.</b> The copy is a copy of the file, so anything a test arranged in memory and
/// did not commit would be invisible to it — the Dry Run would read a baseline the caller's cache is
/// not in, and Apply would then reject the resulting anchor as drift. Saving is the host precondition
/// ADR 0016 names, and having the tests obey it is what proves it is sufficient.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// It costs one project open per call. That is the honest price of not rolling back, and it buys the
/// cross-instance guarantee <see cref="Apply.AnchorsAreCrossCachePortableTests"/> pins down: because
/// the footprint digest is built from canonical ids and field values rather than hvos, an anchor bound
/// on the copy still matches the original.
