/// One blank, seeded project built and saved once for the whole run, from which each test opens a

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <b>Why this exists:</b> creating a project costs about 3.9 seconds; copying the saved 48 KB of it
/// and reopening costs about 35 milliseconds. xUnit builds a fresh instance of a test class per test
/// method, so a per-class cache makes every method pay the 3.9 seconds — minutes of a run spent
/// re-creating a project none of them modified.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Each copy is file-backed, and that is the whole design.</b> The obvious cheaper move is
/// <see cref="ScratchCacheFactory.CreateInMemoryCopy"/>, which is just as fast — and wrong here twice
/// over. A <c>kMemoryOnly</c> cache has no <c>ProjectId.Path</c>, so any test performing a Dry Run
/// fails outright on the guard in <c>ScratchDryRun</c>; and it synthesizes writing systems from the
/// bare language tag, losing collation, fonts and valid characters. Copying files and reopening keeps
/// both properties, for the same cost.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Copies are isolated from each other and from the master, which is never reopened after it is saved.
/// Their directories are deleted when the collection finishes rather than per test, so a failing test
/// leaves its project on disk to inspect.
