/// <summary>
/// <see cref="AnalysisAggregateDiff"/> — ADR 0038 decision 5's "what changed is the difference between two
/// responses", computed from the manual analyses only. There is no separate change-tracking type in this
/// codebase; this is the whole thing.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The rules defended here, in order of how much damage getting them wrong would do:
/// <list type="number">
/// <item><b>Established, updated and removed are three separate lists, never netted.</b> Deleting the
/// last approved analysis on a word form must show up as <c>Removed</c> and must not cancel out against,
/// or be indistinguishable from, an <c>Established</c> entry elsewhere — netting them is exactly the
/// failure ADR 0038 names: a shrinking test suite would look identical to a growing one.</item>
/// <item><b>Removing the last approved analysis never reads as an improvement anywhere.</b> There is no
/// "net" or "score" field on <see cref="ManualAnalysisDiff"/> for a caller to misread — only four lists,
/// and <c>Removed</c> having an entry is the entire story.</item>
/// <item><b>A vanished word form is reported separately from a removed analysis set.</b> The word form
/// object disappearing entirely (ADR 0038 decision 3: no tombstone, no forwarding record) is a different,
/// more serious fact than the same word form persisting with zero approved analyses, and conflating them
/// would make a data loss and a deliberate cleanup look like the same event.</item>
/// <item><b>Comparison is by content digest, never by any per-object or per-response identity.</b> Two
/// <see cref="ApprovedAnalysis"/> records with the same <see cref="ApprovedAnalysis.ContentDigest"/> but
/// different origins (as they would be if rebuilt from a re-created <c>WfiAnalysis</c> with identical
/// content, per ADR 0038 decision 3) must not register as a change.</item>
/// <item><b>Count-only changes and freshly-unanalysed word forms produce no diff entry.</b> Occurrence
/// counts are text churn, and a brand-new word form with no manual analysis carries no expectation
/// (decision 7) — neither is a test change.</item>
/// </list>
/// </remarks>
