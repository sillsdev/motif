/// This is the test the route was chosen for. Motif can read a coverage percentage from any parser; what it
/// cannot do without GUID-keyed analyses is say <i>which entry</i> or <i>which rule</i> an analysis used, and
/// therefore whether a Proposal that edited that entry changed parsing the way it intended. The HermitCrab-XML
/// route answers in synthetic keys (<c>mrule128</c>, <c>entry1083</c>) that name nothing Motif can look up;
/// only the GUID one is usable.

/// <para>
/// So the assertion is not "the parser ran" but <b>"every morpheme the parser named is an object this project
/// actually contains"</b> — checked by resolving each GUID through the live cache's own object repository. If
/// that ever fails, the whole grammar-feedback design fails with it, and it fails silently otherwise: coverage
/// numbers would keep working while correlation quietly returned nothing.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Runs against <see cref="PristineProjectFixture"/>'s two seeded stems rather than a large real project: the
/// claim under test is that a GUID names an object, which the seam either honours or does not regardless of
/// how many entries the project holds.
