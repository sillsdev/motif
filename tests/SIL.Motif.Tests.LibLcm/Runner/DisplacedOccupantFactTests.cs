/// <summary>
/// Settles one factual question: <b>when an <c>owning/atomic</c> slot is overwritten, does the displaced
/// occupant survive as an orphan, or is it destroyed by the assignment?</b> It is destroyed — pinned by
/// `OverwritingAnOwningAtomicSlot_DestroysTheIncumbent_RatherThanLeavingAnOrphan` below, which asks
/// LibLCM directly with no Motif machinery in the way.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The Change Set contract's original reasoning for "Owning-atomic replacement" assumed the opposite —
/// <i>"Implicit detach, not cascade delete... The displaced occupant is a disclosed orphan effect... The runner
/// refuses to apply unless the same Change Set also disposes of the displaced object... Silent orphaning here
/// is the `SetPartOfSpeech`/MSA bug class this contract exists to prevent."</i> The contract now carries a
/// correction recording that this premise is wrong for owning slots, and cites this test for it.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The distinction the original reasoning collapsed: de-referencing a <c>rel</c> genuinely leaves its target
/// alive, so the orphan hazard there is real. Dropping an <em>owned</em> object is not that case — LibLCM's
/// ownership model is exclusive and total, so an owned object its owner lets go of has nowhere left to live.
/// The refuse-unless-disposed rule was written for the reference hazard; over ownership it guards nothing.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Scope of the evidence, stated honestly: verified for <c>LexEntry.LexemeForm</c>, and expected to generalise
/// across the 69 <c>owning/atomic</c> fields because the ownership model is the same for all of them, but not
/// separately verified for each. That is why <c>create</c>-into-occupied ships with no orphan disclosure.
