# Coverage manifest

## Companion files

Six files sit alongside `liblcm-inventory.tsv`, in the same dialect (tab-separated, double-quoted, CRLF).

**`human-judgment-custom-fields.tsv` — the reserved project schema.** It records the one custom field
project initialization creates, including its exact declaring class, internal name, String type, writing
system selector, Notebook storage owner, operation kind and snapshot field. The field is resolved by
`(declaring class, internal name)`; its label and cache-local field id are not identity. The write boundary
names the semantic composer that is allowed to stage its fixed value operation. Judgment subjects remain
typed logical references in the Notebook value, rather than direct custom fields on grammar objects.

**`fieldworks-labels.tsv` — harvested, not authored.** What FieldWorks already shows a linguist for a given
`(class, field)`, scraped from `strings-en.xml`, the `.fwlayout` slice system and the Lists tool config by
`spikes/SIL.Motif.Spikes.LabelHarvest`. One row per *distinct* label, because the same field carries different
labels in different layouts — `MoInflAffixSlot.Name` is "Name" in one and "Slot Name" in another — and picking
one silently would bake a view-specific label into a contract. 768 rows covering 193 of 494 in-scope fields
(39.1%); 212 rows flagged `ambiguous`. **These are labels, not descriptions: only 20 rows carry any prose.**

**`kind-descriptions.tsv` — copied from a source, not written.** One sentence per authorable field saying
*when an agent should reach for this operation*, which is the job a two-word label cannot do. Required by
[ADR 0023](../docs/adr/0023-derived-kind-names-required-descriptions.md) decision 5 as amended: the build
fails if a description is missing **or if it merely restates the label**. Written per family as it ships;
93 rows today.

The `Reviewed` column records provenance, and [issue D8](../docs/issues.md) is why it is not optional — the
first large batch of freely-paraphrased descriptions was 8% wrong, four of them saying the exact opposite of
what the model means, and a backwards sentence reads just as fluently as a correct one. Five values:

| `Reviewed` | Meaning | `Source`/`SourceDetail` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sourced` | copied from a cited upstream sentence, not yet reviewed by a linguist | required |
| `hand-corrected` | corrected by a human against a cited source after an automated error; regeneration preserves the text verbatim | required |
| `adapted` | derived from a **sibling field's** cited source by a checked-in substitution rule, for a field the model documents only once per family | required; cites the sibling, the substitution, and the licence for adapting |
| `unsourced` | no upstream source found yet; the text is an unverified claim | must be empty |
| `no-source-exists` | searched for exhaustively and found nowhere | `none (searched)`, with the search itself in `SourceDetail` |

`SourceHash` is a `sha256:` digest of **the cited fragment** — the upstream sentence itself, not the whole
file and not our copy of it. For a `sourced` row the two texts are the same, so the digest is merely
convenient. It earns its place on the rows whose text deliberately differs from their source: comparing our
prose against upstream cannot detect that upstream moved when our prose is *supposed* to differ, and
`hand-corrected` and `adapted` rows are exactly that case. An `adapted` row stores its **sibling's** digest,
so the two rows cannot drift apart unnoticed.

Hashing the fragment rather than the file is deliberate. `MasterLCModel.xml` backs 66 of these rows, so a
file-level digest there would flag all 66 for a change to any one of them, and a check that cries wolf 66
times is a check nobody reads.

`refresh-descriptions` (below) is what writes this file; it never invents prose, so a row it cannot source
keeps whatever text it already had.

**`fieldworks-help-descriptions.tsv` — harvested, Windows-only, checked in for exactly that reason.** The
`Description:` row of the FieldWorks help page for each of nine fields, pulled out of
`DistFiles/Helps/FieldWorks_Language_Explorer_Help.chm` — the only place several of these sentences exist.
Opening a `.chm` needs `hh.exe`, which is Windows-only, so the extraction is a dev-time step whose output is
committed: **nothing in the build, the tests, or the runtime ever touches the help file.** Re-harvest with
`dotnet run --project src/SIL.Motif.Generator -- harvest-help` (add a path to an already-extracted help tree
to skip the Windows-only step), then `refresh-descriptions`, then commit both files.

**`ordering-evidence.tsv` — what the model says about order, for every row that claims order matters.**
One row per in-scope field whose `ComparisonClass` is not `unordered` (64 today), carrying the sentences of
its `MasterLCModel.xml` comment that speak to ordering, the citation, which ordering words the selection
matched, and a `sha256:` digest of the quote. **Evidence, not authority** — `ComparisonClass` stays derived
from `Card` ([ADR 0022](../docs/adr/0022-structure-is-derived-policy-is-five-rows.md) decision 2), and
nothing reads this file at build time. It answers the question the derivation cannot ask about itself:
*is the rule right for this row?* 32 of the 64 have an explicit statement; 32 rest on `card=seq` alone and
are named in [the census](../docs/research/2026-08-11-ordering-claims-census.md). Re-harvest with
`dotnet run --project src/SIL.Motif.Generator -- harvest-ordering-evidence` (model only — no FieldWorks
checkout needed).

**`source-pins.tsv` — the three files the descriptions are copied out of, pinned by content.** One row per
file: `MasterLCModel.xml`, `ContextHelp.xml`, and the compiled help file, each with a `sha256:` digest of
its bytes, plus the release it came from (liblcm by pinned package version, FieldWorks by
`git describe --tags --long` — both repos sit some commits past a tag, so the long form is deliberate).

`refresh-descriptions` **fails** rather than re-harvesting when one of those files has changed, naming the
file and both digests; re-run with `--accept-source-move` to upgrade deliberately, which re-pins and prints
every description whose upstream fragment drifted. That report is the point: a reworded upstream sentence
still reads fluently, so nothing downstream would otherwise notice that the sentence a reviewer signed off
on has been replaced.

**The check is on content, not on commits** — and that is a correction, not a preference. The first version
pinned each repository at a commit and refused to run within the hour, because the FieldWorks checkout had
advanced by one commit adding three unrelated test files. A pin that fires on every commit to a large
repository trains its reader to click through it. A project that moves without changing any of these three
files is now reported and re-pinned, not treated as a reason to stop.

The `.chm` is pinned even though `refresh-descriptions` never opens it: the checked-in help harvest is
derived from it, so a changed digest there is the only thing that can say "re-run `harvest-help`".

## `liblcm-inventory.tsv` — the raw inventory (generated, checked in)

Every property of every LibLCM class, generated mechanically from
`MasterLCModel.xml` as shipped inside the pinned `SIL.LCModel` NuGet package
(`contentFiles/MasterLCModel.xml`) — so the inventory is version-locked to
exactly the LibLCM assembly Motif references, with no dependency on a sibling
repository checkout.

898 rows, 19 columns. The first nine are the raw inventory, generated mechanically; the other ten
are added by [`classify.ps1`](classify.ps1) (see "The manifest is now the type system" below) and are
blank/`n/a` for every row where `Scope != in`.

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Class` | LibLCM class name |
| `Base` | its base class |
| `Abstract` | `true` if the class cannot be instantiated |
| `Scope` | `in` (domain-reachable, authorable), `trace` (derivation-trace — analyzer output, never authored), `out` |
| `ScopeReason` | why that scope was assigned |
| `Field` | property name |
| `Kind` | `basic` (value) / `owning` / `rel` (reference) |
| `Sig` | value type, or destination class for relations |
| `Card` | `atomic` / `col` / `seq` |
| `HcReferenced` | raw name-only join against [`hcloader-surface.tsv`](hcloader-surface.tsv): `name-referenced` or `no`. Precursor to `HcReachable`, which corrects the false positives a bare-name join produces (see issue D1 in [issues.md](../docs/issues.md)). |
| `Construct` | the layer-1 construct this field belongs to (`lexEntry`, `msa`, `phoneme`, `rewriteRule`, …; the possibility family fans out to a multi-construct string) — see [ADR 0009](../docs/adr/0009-layered-api-primitives-and-composers.md) and [API surface layer 1](../docs/api-surface-layer1.md). 54 distinct constructs across the in-scope rows. |
| `Group` | `grammar` / `lexical` / `system` / `lists` / `analysis` — **the editorial domain: who should review a change**, per [ADR 0024](../docs/adr/0024-group-is-derived-domain-is-editorial.md). It is *not* the first segment of an operation's name; that segment is derived from the declaring class and the two deliberately disagree on 53 rows. `analysis` was added by [ADR 0025](../docs/adr/0025-parser-first-build-order.md). |
| `Classification` | what kind of field this is for kind-generation purposes: `semantic-operation` (core authorable content), `supporting-detail` (secondary/administrative), `unsupported` (explicitly not offered as a control), `internal` (import residue, singleton roots), `derived-read-only` (engine-computed), `runner-bookkeeping` (the applied-log's reuse of `CmResource`), `observable-not-authorable` (engine-maintained reverse index). |
| `ComparisonClass` | how instances of this field compare for drift/effect purposes: `unordered`, `positional`, `index-as-identity` (alpha-variable pools — [issue B8](../docs/issues.md)), `feeding` (order encodes rule interaction — [issue B8](../docs/issues.md)). |
| `Verbs` | the CRUD verb subset this field's `(Kind, Card)` shape generates (`set|clear`, `create|delete`, `create|delete|move|reparent`, `addRef|removeRef`, `addRef|removeRef|move`), or `n/a` when `Classification` marks the field non-authorable. |
| `HcReachable` | does `HCLoader` actually read this field — `yes` / `no` / `unconfirmed`, corrected from `HcReferenced` against the curated surface map (see [the HC grammar map](../docs/hc-grammar-map.md)). |
| `EnumValues` | for the 28 in-scope `Integer` fields only: a confirmed `value=Name;...` mapping, `unknown` (named-enum-shaped but no confirming code found), or blank (a magnitude, not an enumeration) — [issue B7](../docs/issues.md). |
| `Rationale` | required prose for every in-scope row, citing the classification decision and folding in any `ComparisonClass`/`HcReachable`/`EnumValues` notes. Distinguishes a cited source from a generic field-name-heuristic default — see [issue B18](../docs/issues.md). |

### `Scope` is computed, not guessed

Scope is **owning-edge reachability** from the domain roots — `LexDb`, `MoMorphData`, `PhPhonData`,
`FsFeatureSystem`, `PartOfSpeech`, and `LexEntry` (the last because `LexDb` only *references* entries,
never owns them) — plus the declared `CmPossibility` subclasses that in-scope lists use, minus the
derivation-trace family. Polymorphic expansion is deliberately blocked at broad bases (`CmObject`,
`CmPossibility`, `CmPossibilityList`, …), since a list's legal item class is governed per-instance by
`ItemClsid` at runtime rather than by the schema.

A naming heuristic was wrong in **both** directions, which is why this is computed:

- **Admitted what it shouldn't:** the `MoDeriv*` / `*App` derivation-trace family (9 classes, 28 props)
  looks like grammar but is reachable only from `WfiAnalysis.Derivation`, an out-of-scope interlinear
  class. It is analyzer output. Tagged `Scope=trace`.
- **Excluded what it shouldn't:** `CmPossibility`, `CmPossibilityList`, `CmMedia`, `CmPicture`,
  `CmTranslation`, `CmResource` (the applied-log), `StText`/`StPara` — no domain prefix, but they back
  in-scope fields.

**In scope: 494 properties across 100 classes** (494 = 214 `basic` + 148 `owning` + 132 `rel`). Was 473
across 95 until [ADR 0025](../docs/adr/0025-parser-first-build-order.md) brought in 21 analysis rows —
the approval half of word analysis, which has durable identity. Occurrence assignment
(`Segment.Analyses`) remains out. Basic —
MultiUnicode 52, MultiString 51, Unicode 35, Integer 28, Boolean 25, String 10, Time 5, Guid 2,
TextPropBinary 1. Relations — owning/atomic 69, rel/atomic 57, owning/col 39, rel/col 38, owning/seq 33,
rel/seq 28. Excluded as `trace`: 28 props across 9 classes.

An earlier count of 478 properties across 96 classes included 5 `TextTag` rows later demoted as a
scope over-inclusion — see [issue D5](../docs/issues.md). The numbers above are post-D5 and were
recomputed directly from the TSV, not adjusted by hand from the old figures.

**This file is the drift-detection artifact.** Regenerating it after a LibLCM package bump must produce
no diff; any diff is a model change requiring review and (re)classification.

## The manifest is now the type system

Classification has shipped (commit `66fe792`). Every in-scope row carries all ten classification
columns — **zero in-scope rows are unclassified** — turning `liblcm-inventory.tsv` from a raw
inventory into the type system the (not-yet-written) kind generator is meant to read: per
[ADR 0009](../docs/adr/0009-layered-api-primitives-and-composers.md) and
[API surface layer 1](../docs/api-surface-layer1.md), each field's `Construct`, `Classification`,
`ComparisonClass`, `Verbs`, `HcReachable` (does `HCLoader` read it — see
[the HC grammar map](../docs/hc-grammar-map.md)) and `EnumValues` (for the 28
in-scope `Integer` fields), and `Rationale` are all populated. See the column table above for what
each one means and the value set it takes.

[`classify.ps1`](classify.ps1) is the mechanized, checked-in, re-runnable producer of these columns.
**But it has fallen behind the file, and rerunning it now loses work:** as of 2026-08-06 it rewrites 26
rows — the `CmAgent`/`TextTag`/`Wfi*` families — reverting the `Group`/`HcReachable`/`Rationale` values
that [ADR 0025](../docs/adr/0025-parser-first-build-order.md)'s analysis-approval scoping set by hand,
because the script does not know about that ADR. Treat it as a **first-pass tool**, and diff its output
against the committed file before accepting it. See [issue D7](../docs/issues.md).

### What genuinely still remains

- **No kind generator yet.** The manifest is the type system a generator would read, but nothing in
  `src/` reads `Construct`/`Classification`/`Verbs` to emit operation kinds. Today's runner still
  implements exactly one hand-written operation, `lexical/lexSense/setGloss`.
- **`manifest/generate-inventory.ps1` does not exist.** The raw first-nine-column inventory was
  produced by ad-hoc commands rather than a committed script, so the drift gate this file's opening
  section promises ("regenerating it after a LibLCM package bump must produce no diff") cannot
  actually be re-run yet. Tracked as [issue D6](../docs/issues.md).
- **Confidence caveats.** `HcReachable` is `unconfirmed` for 7 in-scope rows pending an HCLoader-read
  citation ([issue B17](../docs/issues.md) calls out `MoMorphSynAnalysis.Components`/`GlossBundle`
  specifically). Most rows carry no citation — **but this stopped being a risk on 2026-08-05.** The
  generator no longer trusts these columns: `Verbs` and `ComparisonClass` are **derived** from LibLCM's own
  structural declarations with five cited exceptions, and the build fails on any unexplained departure
  ([ADR 0022](../docs/adr/0022-structure-is-derived-policy-is-five-rows.md)); the operation name is derived
  from the declaring class ([ADR 0023](../docs/adr/0023-derived-kind-names-required-descriptions.md)). A
  missing citation on a computed value is not a defect. What still rests on human judgement, and where a
  citation therefore earns its place: `Scope`, `Construct` (what ships together), `Group` (who reviews), and
  the five order-carries-meaning rows.
