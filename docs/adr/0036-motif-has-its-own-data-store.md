# ADR 0036 — Motif has its own data store, and only curated subsets cross into FieldWorks

Large text collections and research data can exceed a language project by many times. Motif keeps its own data store so FieldWorks stays focused on the project, with only deliberate changes crossing over.

**Status:** accepted, 2026-08-09; storage layout amended by
[ADR 0039](0039-one-worker-baseline-and-live-host-authority.md). The separate-store and deliberate-promotion
decisions remain binding. Decision 6's file/database split is historical: one paired SQLite database now
holds all local workflow state while content digests retain immutable identity.

**In plain terms:** the data Motif works with is about to be far larger than the project it describes. Pulling
text from Wikipedia and elsewhere to measure how much of a language a grammar reaches — and to build spelling
correction and word-prediction models from the same text — means tens to hundreds of megabytes. None of that
belongs in the FieldWorks project: it would bloat the file, and hand Chorus a merge it cannot do. **So Motif
keeps its own store**, and material crosses into FieldWorks only when somebody deliberately promotes a curated
subset of it.

## Why this outgrew the previous decision

ADR 0035 put stored Assessments in the proposal store on the grounds that an Assessment is a cache — losing it
costs a rerun, not data. That reasoning holds and this ADR does not disturb it. What changed is scale and
kind:

- **Corpora from outside the project.** A grammar's reach is measured against real running text, and the
  interesting text is not the project's own handful of interlinearised stories. At Wikipedia scale this is
  10–100 MB before any analysis.
- **A second consumer that is not the parser.** Spelling correction and word-prediction n-grams are built from
  the same text. That makes the corpus a first-class asset rather than a parser input.
- **Analyses at that scale.** Parsing 100,000 word forms produces roughly 64 MB of results
  ([ADR 0035](0035-reports-are-advisory-queries-over-stored-assessments.md)); a project accumulates several.

## Decision

### 1. Motif stores its own data, outside the FieldWorks project

Corpora, their provenance, Assessments, n-gram models and reports live in Motif's store. **Nothing about that
data enters the `.fwdata` by default.**

Two reasons, and the second is the one that forecloses the alternative. Size: a project file is a working
document a linguist copies, backs up and syncs, and multiplying it by an order of magnitude with material they
did not author changes what it is. And merge: Motif already has one unresolved risk from writing a few
kilobytes of applied log into the project, because **Chorus three-way-merges the `.fwdata` with no idea what
any of it means**. Handing it megabytes of corpus and analysis would turn a known risk into a certainty.

### 2. Curated subsets are promoted into FieldWorks deliberately

The store is not a walled garden. **A subset can be pulled into the project for analysis** — the words a
linguist wants to interlinearise, the stems worth adding to the lexicon, the analyses worth keeping. That
crossing is an explicit act, reviewable like any other change, and it is the only route in.

This is the shape the rest of the design already assumes. [ADR 0032](0032-stem-assessment-is-pangloss-supplied-lexicon.md)
puts stem evaluation in a throwaway overlay and gives Motif the job of **promotion** — the one thing PanGloss
declares a non-goal. Promotion from the corpus store is the same act with a different source.

### 3. A corpus is text; a Selection is a derived word set. They are different objects

This distinction was blurred and the blur was about to cost something. `CorpusDescriptor` deduplicates and
sorts, which is right for the set of distinct forms handed to the parser and **destroys exactly what the other
consumers need**: frequency ranks the unparsed-form worklist, and sequence is what n-gram models are built
from.

So the corpus keeps its running text, its order and its repetition. A Selection is derived from it, and
deduplication belongs there.

### 4. Every corpus states its origin and tokenisation; qualification is separate and usually absent

Recorded on the corpus, not alongside it:

- **Origin** — description, location, retrieval date, and **licence**. Wikipedia is CC-BY-SA, and a project
  publishing a dictionary derived from it carries an attribution obligation. The moment to record that is when
  the text arrives.
- **Tokenisation** — method, version, and what it did with punctuation, numerals, mixed script and case. At
  corpus scale **tokenisation decides most of what "unparsed" means**: a form invented by splitting on an
  apostrophe fails to parse and reads as a gap in the grammar. Two corpora tokenised differently are not
  comparable even when the source text is identical.
- **Qualification** — a named person's dated claim that the corpus is clean and in scope, with their reason.
  **Optional, usually absent, and its absence is meaningful.**

### 5. Reach and correctness need different corpora, and the code refuses to confuse them

A large uncurated corpus is **excellent evidence of reach** — what share of real running text a grammar
touches, and which unparsed forms are most frequent, which is the best available worklist for what to add next.
It is **worthless as evidence of correctness**, because a failed analysis there is ambiguous between a real
gap, a typo, and a token the grammar was never meant to cover. Those demand opposite responses, and one number
averaging them tells a project to work on whichever cause is loudest rather than whichever matters.

So a corpus without a qualification **cannot produce an accuracy figure at all** — not a footnoted one. The
report states that accuracy is not computable and why, and says reach figures remain valid. *"I could not
look"* must never read as *"everything is fine"*, and a precision figure over unvetted text is that failure in
its most persuasive form, because it looks like evidence.

### 6. The store is split by kind: files for documents, an embedded database for bulk

> **Superseded by ADR 0039.** This section records the earlier layout. The accepted layout is one sibling
> `Project.motif.db` for Proposals, workflow records, Corpora, and Assessments; content addressing remains a
> contract property rather than a requirement that each object occupy a separate file.

Decided 2026-08-09, closing the question this ADR first left open.

| What | Where | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Proposals, Receipts** | **Files**, content-addressed | Small, immutable, and their identity *is* their content hash. A database would add nothing and take away the property that makes identity work. Being readable with a text editor has had real value throughout development |
| **Corpora, Assessments** | **An embedded database** | Large, queried in aggregate, and pruned. "The hundred most frequent unparsed forms" over 100 MB is a scan on a filesystem, and Reports are required to be *exceptionally cheap* ([ADR 0035](0035-reports-are-advisory-queries-over-stored-assessments.md)) |

**The two halves have opposite requirements, which is why one mechanism cannot serve both.** A filesystem gives
bulk data no aggregate query and no pruning, so we would end up writing an index — a database with worse
guarantees. A database gives immutable content-addressed documents nothing they do not already have, and costs
them their inspectability.

**SQLite is the expected engine**, and the argument is organisational rather than technical: FwLite's
`LcmCrdt` already stores local data with `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite` and `SQLitePCLRaw`, so it is
the house choice, the team knows it, and a second embedded database in the same organisation would need a
reason. It is also a single file, so it keeps the property that a linguist can back the store up by copying —
and it needs no server, which [ADR 0031](0031-collaboration-follows-the-data-not-the-surface.md) rules out.

**One constraint to prove before committing to a specific package**, and it has a precedent here: scope 2
hosts Motif inside FieldWorks on `net48`, where EF Core 6+ does not run. `MOT-13` already exists to prove
`System.Text.Json` on `net48` for exactly this reason. The same proof is owed for whatever data-access
library is chosen — and the store today lives in `SIL.Motif.Host`, which targets `net10.0` only, so this is a
scope-2 question rather than a blocker now.

## Consequences

- **The proposal store becomes the Motif store**, and its shape is now a real design question rather than a
  folder of JSON: corpora, Assessments and n-gram models have different lifetimes, sizes and pruning rules.
  Not designed here.
- **Promotion into FieldWorks needs a surface** — which words, which analyses, and what the record of that
  crossing looks like. Named by decision 2, not built.
- **FieldWorks has no model for a corpus attestation**, checked on 2026-08-09: `CmAgentEvaluation` carries a
  bare approve/disapprove with no date and no reason, and `Text` offers only a free-text `Source`. So this
  record has no FieldWorks counterpart to align with — unlike the parser-report counts, which
  [ADR 0033](0033-three-systems-and-who-owns-which-measure.md) deliberately mirrors.
- **Licence obligations become trackable**, which is a reason to want this beyond measurement: a project that
  cannot say where its word list came from cannot safely publish from it.
- **Risk accepted:** a store outside the project is a store outside the backup, the sync and the habits built
  around the `.fwdata`. Losing it costs reruns and re-pulls rather than authored work — everything in it is
  either cached or re-fetchable — but "everything in it is derived" is a property that must be *maintained*,
  and the first genuinely authored thing to land there breaks it.
