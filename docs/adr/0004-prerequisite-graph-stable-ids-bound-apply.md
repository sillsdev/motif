# ADR 0004 — Prerequisite graph, stable uniquely-minted identity, and bound apply

**In plain terms:** A group of edits may depend on earlier edits, and the project can change before they are applied. Stable identities and declared dependencies let Motif detect when those edits no longer describe the same work.

Status: accepted (2026-07-24)

## Context

A plan review compared Motif against Terraform, Django/EF Core migrations, Git/IPFS content
addressing, and Flyway/Liquibase. Three findings warranted decisions.

## Decisions

### 1. Prerequisites are a directed acyclic graph, not a single-parent tree

The earlier design let a Change Set declare one prerequisite, forming a tree of chains. A tree cannot
express two independently-authored Change Sets — one lexical (Linguistic Assistant), one grammar
(PanGloss) — later jointly required by a third without imposing a false order between them. That is
the diamond dependency that pushed Django migrations to a DAG and that EF Core's linear history is
the documented failure mode of. `requires` is therefore a set of `changeSetId`s. The reachable
prerequisite graph must be acyclic (topological-sort cycle detection); a dependent is assessed and
tested against the state with its full closure applied in topological order. The cost is identical to
the tree — a set instead of a scalar, the same "apply prerequisites first" fixture technique.

### 2. changeSetId is uniquely minted at creation then frozen; intent digest is the live content hash

Both pure content-addressing (id = hash of content) and content-seeding were rejected: a Change Set is
a mutable authoring artifact whose id must survive edits (or `requires` links and applied-log entries
dangle), *and* content-derived ids collide for degenerate content — ten Change Sets that each start
empty `{}` and diverge would share one id. Identity is therefore unique by construction, not content:

- `changeSetId` is a **128-bit id minted when the Change Set is created** — content-independent, unique
  by construction (a time-ordered value: millisecond timestamp plus random bits, in the standard
  suffix convention) — and then **frozen**. It never changes on edit or rebase, and is the sole
  linkage target.
- The **intent digest** is the live content hash (full SHA-256), recomputed on every edit. Identical
  authored intent yields an identical digest, so content equality and tamper-evidence are queries on
  the digest, not the id.
- The applied-log records both: it matches on the stable `changeSetId` (*was this exact Change Set
  applied?*) and stores the intent digest (*was this content already applied?* — the Flyway/Liquibase
  checksum pattern), surfacing a later apply whose content differs from the recorded one.

The intent digest stays a pure function of content — it excludes `changeSetId` — and rebase is
coherent: an amendment moves the intent digest and keeps the id.

### 3. Apply is bound to a prior Assessment

Terraform's default-safe workflow binds `apply` to a saved plan and refuses if state moved
underneath. Motif's apply previously treated a prior Assessment as optional, leaving the
assess→apply window a caller-managed race. Apply now requires a prior Assessment; its footprint digest
binds apply to a specific evaluated baseline, and a moved footprint stops apply with a drift
diagnostic. A bare apply with no bound Assessment is a hard error.

## Consequences

- `requires` becomes an array; the contract, conflict taxonomy, and fixtures speak of a prerequisite
  graph and closure.
- Identity and content are two fields with distinct lifecycles; the applied-log carries an added
  packed field for the intent digest.
- Apply gains a mandatory bound-Assessment precondition, closing the TOCTOU race by default.
