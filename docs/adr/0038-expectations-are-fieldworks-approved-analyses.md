# ADR 0038 — Expectations are FieldWorks' approved analyses; Motif reads them in aggregate

A grammar change should be checked against examples a linguist has approved. FieldWorks already holds those examples, so Motif reads them and reports whether the parser still produces them.

**Status:** accepted, 2026-08-09. Refines [ADR 0033](0033-three-systems-and-who-owns-which-measure.md) on who
owns which measure, and [ADR 0035](0035-reports-are-advisory-queries-over-stored-assessments.md) on reports
being advisory queries.

**In plain terms:** when someone changes a grammar rule, the question is *did that help, and did it break
anything*. The answer needs something to check against. **We are not building that something — FieldWorks
already has it.** A linguist's approved analyses are exactly a set of assertions about what particular words
should mean, which is what a test is. Motif reads them, runs the parser, and reports where the two disagree.

The analogy that shaped this, from the owner: **approved analyses are unit tests; running text is code
coverage.** One is a small set of deliberate assertions; the other is broad evidence about how much of the
language the grammar reaches.

## Decision

### 1. A Selection is an explicit list of words, not a query

We nearly built a query language with pinned results and a re-run lifecycle. It was wrong, and the reason is
worth keeping: **a query can only express sets that have a unifying principle**, and the normal case has
none. A person has ten or twenty words they care about for ten or twenty different reasons.

So a Selection is the words, listed out, with a note of where they came from. A list can be *exported* from an
Assessment — "everything that failed to parse" — but what is stored is the words. Nothing is re-derived, so
nothing goes stale, and the elaborate provenance chain a re-runnable query would have needed does not exist.

**What we give up:** re-running the same intent against a corpus that has since grown is a fresh manual
export rather than a button. Accepted.

### 2. Expectations live in FieldWorks; the type-level composite is the test

Two things look alike and are not:

- **One occurrence being manually analysed** is the *authoring gesture*. It needs to survive churn well
  enough not to lose the thread, and it **makes no grammatical claim** — which reading a particular sentence
  got is disambiguation, not grammar.
- **The composite of all approved analyses on a word form** is the *durable test*. Adding one establishes a
  test, changing one updates it, removing the last removes it.

So positive expectations need nothing new from Motif. They already exist, in the right grain, in the language
project — where they belong, because an approved analysis is a linguistic fact that outlives Motif.

**A word form can carry several approved analyses at once**, because genuinely ambiguous forms have more than
one correct reading. The unit is therefore a *set*, never "the analysis".

### 3. Key on the word form, compare analyses by content

`WfiAnalysis` GUIDs are **not durable identity**, verified in the FieldWorks source on 2026-08-09:

- Editing a breakdown to something that matches no existing analysis creates a **new** `WfiAnalysis` and
  **deletes the old approved one outright** (`FocusBoxController.ApproveAndMove.cs:404-405`).
- Whether the GUID survives depends on **how many other occurrences share it** — `OnlyUsedThisOnce` mutates
  in place when it is used once and forks a new object when it is shared. The same edit produces different
  identity outcomes depending on unrelated state.
- `Segment.AnalysesRS` is a **reference** sequence, not owning (`MasterLCModel.xml:268`), so one analysis is
  shared across arbitrarily many occurrences.

`WfiWordform` GUID is stable. So records key on the word form, and analyses are compared **by content** —
`MatchesIWfiAnalysis`, which is FieldWorks' own definition of "same analysis" and ignores identity entirely.

**A caveat this leaves standing:** a word form is found-or-created *by its text*, so correcting a spelling in
a text repoints the occurrence at a **different word form** and may delete the old one. The `Form` field never
changes. Watching `Form` therefore catches spelling edits made directly and misses the ordinary case
entirely.

**Decided 2026-08-09 — a vanished word form is reported as vanished, and Motif does not chase it.**
`CmObject.MergeObject` transfers every reference to the destination and then deletes the source — *"the given
object will be deleted in this method, so don't expect it to be valid, afterwards"* — leaving no forwarding
record and no tombstone. So when a change set's word form disappears, Motif says exactly that and the person
re-selects.

**The premise that makes this cheap: a spelling mistake is actually a mistake.** A corrected typo is not one
word becoming another; it is a wrong word being replaced by the right one. There is no identity to preserve
across the correction, so there is nothing lost by declining to trace it.

Deliberately *not* built: heuristic recovery — inferring that the vanished form became a similar-looking new
one. It would be wrong in exactly the case that hurts, two genuinely different words that happen to resemble
each other, and it is the same class of claim decision 6 refuses. A forwarding record for corrections Motif
itself applied can be added later if the reported-and-stop behaviour proves too blunt; nothing here forecloses
it.

### 4. The before-state must be captured, because FieldWorks destroys it

Update and delete-then-create are the same operation in FieldWorks, and nothing retains what a test used to
be. So *"this was this, and is now this"* is **not answerable after the fact** — the previous approved
analysis is gone.

The approved analysis set therefore belongs in the **comparison footprint**
([conflicts-and-rebase.md](../conflicts-and-rebase.md)) of any change set that touches it. That is existing
machinery, not new machinery, but omitting it makes the query silently return half an answer.

**The footprint for an analysis change set is:** word form GUID, its `Form`, the content digest of its
approved analysis set, and **existence**. Not the occurrence list — occurrence references change every time
anyone edits any text containing the word, almost never affecting what the change set means, and a footprint
that goes stale constantly trains people to ignore staleness. Existence is in because `DeleteIfSpurious`
collects unreferenced word forms, and a change set targeting a collected word form is not stale but broken.

### 5. One read API, and "what changed" is the difference between two responses

Rather than a change-tracking type, there is a query: **per word form, the aggregate of its analyses — manual
and automatic** — with links through to the words, counts and instances per manual analysis, and an option to
run the parser over all of them and compare against what is recorded.

**The aggregate never parses. Decided 2026-08-09, closing a contradiction between two earlier decisions.**
An earlier draft of this decision offered "an option to run the parser over all of them and compare", which
collides directly with [ADR 0035](0035-reports-are-advisory-queries-over-stored-assessments.md)'s requirement
that a Report be *"a cheap query — a few searches and some statistics"*. Parsing 100,000 word forms is not that.

So the boundary is drawn hard: **reading the aggregate never triggers a parse.** It reads whatever Assessment
exists, and where one is missing or stale it *says so* rather than fixing it. Producing an Assessment is a
separate, slow, explicitly-invoked verb.

Two earlier rulings already required this. *"If it changes and we didn't do it, just say analysis is invalid —
rerun"* is incompatible with a read that could silently start a ten-minute parse. And rerunning is *"as per
the discretion of the user"* — a flag on a read call is not discretion, it is discretion the first time
somebody reads the documentation and a surprise every time after. A single call whose cost varies by three
orders of magnitude according to invisible state is a thing people learn to fear rather than use.

**A consequence worth having:** this unblocks the aggregate from Assessment storage. With nothing stored it
returns the manual analyses plus "no analysis on record" — already useful, because the manual side *is* the
test suite and needs no parser at all. `MOT-23` therefore does not wait on `MOT-20`.

**This is a Report, not a new concept.** `CONTEXT.md` already defines one as *"a query over an Assessment and
the project's own data, producing statistics and findings — advisory always"*. That is precisely this, so it
inherits the existing rules rather than needing its own: it gates nothing, and it renders no verdict.

**Change falls out of diffing two responses.** Differences in the automatic analyses are grammar coverage
moving; differences in counts are text churn; what remains — differences in the manual analyses — is a test
being established, updated or removed. Nothing separate to design, nothing to keep in sync.

**Established, updated and removed are always reported separately and never netted against passing.**
Deleting the last approved analysis on a word form improves every aggregate while reducing what is checked —
the grammar equivalent of deleting a failing test. It is also *routinely correct*, which is why it is
reported rather than warned about: flagging the honest case as a transgression is how people learn to route
around warnings.

### 6. Motif does not attribute cause

An earlier draft split results into "matched because the grammar improved" and "matched because the
expectation moved". **That was wrong** — the evidence does not support it. We know the analysis changed and
we know it passes now; which caused which is exactly what we cannot see, and the grammar change may well have
helped the words whose analyses also changed.

So Motif reports the facts side by side and declines to infer. This is the same rule that makes a **Hole**
undecided by construction.

### 7. A word with no analysis gets no expectation — only a counted, explicitly weak signal

Added 2026-08-09, closing the gap decision 2 left open.

Earlier drafts wanted a home for *this word is correctly spelled and should nevertheless not be analysed* — a
borrowed proper noun, a code-switch — because FieldWorks cannot say it. **We are not building one.**

**Wait until there is an analysis.** A word form that nobody has analysed carries no expectation, and Motif
does nothing about it. The only thing reported is a count: **of the correctly-spelled word forms with no
manual analysis, how many does the grammar parse.**

**That number is weak evidence, and it is weak in a specific direction that matters here.** Nobody has checked
these words, so a parse is not known to be a *correct* parse. A rising number is equally consistent with the
grammar improving and with the grammar getting looser — and looseness is the failure mode this project exists
to catch. So it can support a claim about **reach** — a floor under how much of the language is touched — and
never a claim about correctness. Same asymmetry [ADR 0036](0036-motif-has-its-own-data-store.md) decision 5
applies to unattested corpora, one layer down.

It is therefore reported plainly and used for one thing: **assessing a claim of complete language coverage.**
Outside that, it should not be quoted, and the report says so.

### 8. A stale figure is stated in the past tense, and every figure names the state it describes

Added 2026-08-09.

A stored Assessment can outlive the grammar it measured. When it has, the report **still gives the numbers** —
in the past tense: *"As of the assessment over corpus 'seh-wikipedia' (aaaa…) under grammar cccc…, grammar
coverage was 62.0%. Since then, the grammar has changed (now 8888…), so this describes a state that no longer
exists."*

**Why not refuse.** A stale coverage figure is unlike the two things Motif does refuse to state. An accuracy
figure over unvetted text is a number about nothing, its uncertainty unbounded and undirected. A causal
attribution across a proposal that moved both rules and expectations is a claim the evidence cannot support.
A stale figure is neither: it is a **correct measurement of a state that has since changed**, and *"it was 62%
under the old grammar"* is exactly what a reviewer needs in order to judge whether a change helped. Refusing
would cost real evidence without making anyone safer.

**Why tense rather than a caveat.** The hazard everywhere else in this design is a footnoted number, because
the footnote is what gets dropped when somebody quotes it. **A present-tense number with an asterisk gets
quoted as current; a past-tense sentence cannot be, because the date is inside the claim rather than beside
it.** So the defence is grammar, not suppression.

**This only works if it is unconditional**, which the owner asked to be held to. So it is enforced by the type
rather than by discipline: `GrammarCoverageFigure.Describe(currentCorpusSha256, currentGrammarSourceSha256)`
is the only way to render a figure and **has no parameterless overload**. A caller cannot produce a bare
number without stating what current is, so a figure can never appear without the corpus and grammar that give
it meaning. Adding a shorter overload would kill the rule, because every caller would use it —
`EveryRenderingNamesTheCorpusAndTheGrammar` exists to make that regression fail.

The existing refusals survive rendering too: a lower bound says so in either tense, and nothing-adjudicated
never renders as a percentage. A caveat that lives in the record but not in the prose has not survived, because
the prose is what people read.

## Consequences

- **`MOT-23`** — the aggregate read API above. Not built.
- **`MOT-22`** — `WfiWordform.SpellingStatus` read and written by Motif, so "that one isn't a word" sticks.
- **The only negative Motif records is "not correctly spelled"** (`MOT-22`). *Correctly spelled but should
  not be analysed* is deliberately not modelled — decision 7. `HumanAndParserAgree` exists in liblcm as
  `throw new NotImplementedException()`, so that ground was surveyed once and abandoned upstream too; worth a
  conversation if the weak signal ever proves insufficient, and not worth blocking on.
- **A useful interaction:** `DeleteIfSpurious` refuses to delete a word form whose `SpellingStatus` is not
  `undecided` — *"we know something about it that we don't want to forget"*. Marking junk as `incorrect` is
  therefore what stops it evaporating and taking the negative evidence with it.
- **Terminology moved**, recorded in `CONTEXT.md`: **feature coverage** is the measure of which declared
  features and combinations the analysed words exercise; **grammar coverage** now means how much of a
  language the grammar reaches. `GrammarCoverageFigure` and `ModelCoverageReport` were renamed to match.
- **Deferred deliberately:** spelling corrections — a mistyped form paired with what was meant — are a
  separate Motif data type, not designed until spelling correction is built.
