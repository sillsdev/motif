/// The three belong together because one token authorises all of them. A claim mints it, a renewal proves
/// with it that the row is still this runner's, and finishing has to prove the same thing again — because
/// between the two the row may have been reclaimed, and the reclaim minted a different token. A caller
/// holding the three separately has to know that, and getting it wrong either reports an outcome for
/// somebody else's work or leaves a row running under a lease nobody will renew, which is unclaimable
/// until it expires and which a user experiences as the product losing their work.
/// </para>

/// Claiming is safe against other processes without any lock of ours. SQLite admits a single writer at a
/// time, and that global write lock is the serialisation, so the claim is one conditional statement: the

/// between. Affecting zero rows is an ordinary outcome, not an error.
