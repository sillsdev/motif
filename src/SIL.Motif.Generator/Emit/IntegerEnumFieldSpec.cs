/// <param name="SnapshotFieldConstant">The <c>SnapshotFields</c> constant name:
/// <c>DeclaringClass + FieldName</c>, matching <see cref="BasicFieldSpec"/>'s collision-resistance

/// (the manifest README), in ascending value order — e.g. <c>[(0, "Undecided"), (1, "Correct"),
/// (2, "Incorrect")]</c> for <c>WfiWordform.SpellingStatus</c>. Drives both the payload's range check
/// and the values named in a validation failure message — the point being that an out-of-range value
/// fails loudly rather than reaching LibLCM's own (unrelied-upon) validation.</param>
/// <param name="ZeroMemberName">
/// The name of the <c>0</c> member — <c>Undecided</c> for <c>WfiWordform.SpellingStatus</c> — which is
/// what <c>clear</c> writes, and which the generated documentation names so a caller reads what clearing
/// actually does rather than assuming it erases something. This shape requires every enum to have a zero
/// member: <c>clear</c> would otherwise have to write a value outside the field's own confirmed set,
/// which is exactly what this shape's range check exists to stop.
