/// <summary>
/// ADR 0023 decision 5: every emitted kind must carry a hand-written description, and
/// <b>the build fails if one is missing or if it merely restates the title.</b>
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// The second half is the point. The original decision said only that a description was mandatory, and the
/// FieldWorks label harvest then showed why presence alone is not a bar: it produced 768 rows of labels but
/// <b>only 20 with any prose at all</b>. Everything else is a two-word label — <c>"Form"</c>,
/// <c>"IsAbstract"</c> — which satisfies a presence check and helps nobody. A mandatory field with no quality
/// bar gets filled with the label, and then the check is ceremony rather than infrastructure.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Scoped to the kinds actually being emitted, not to the whole manifest.</b> Descriptions are written per
/// family as it ships, so at any moment most in-scope fields have none — 14 of roughly 480 today. Checking
/// every row would fail the build permanently and force someone to write 480 sentences before the generator
/// could emit anything, which is the opposite of what the ADR decided.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// A <c>draft</c> description passes. The <c>Reviewed</c> column tracks linguist sign-off but does not gate:
/// unreviewed prose is a documentation risk, not a data-corruption risk, and blocking emission on a linguist's
/// availability would make the generator hostage to a review queue.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b>Presence and non-restatement are not enough.</b> A batch of "draft" descriptions was 8% wrong, four of
/// those inverted, and the check that passed them could not see it because polarity is invisible to a
/// mechanical text check. What <i>is</i> checkable is whether the description claims a source:
/// <see cref="KindDescription.Reviewed"/> must be one of five documented values (<c>sourced</c>,
/// <c>hand-corrected</c>, <c>adapted</c>, <c>unsourced</c>, <c>no-source-exists</c> — the manifest README),
/// and a row claiming any of those but <c>unsourced</c> must actually carry a
/// <see cref="KindDescription.Source"/> and <see cref="KindDescription.SourceDetail"/> citation. This does not
/// catch a wrong paraphrase of a real citation, but it does catch the weaker and cheaper-to-produce failure of
/// claiming provenance that was never recorded.
