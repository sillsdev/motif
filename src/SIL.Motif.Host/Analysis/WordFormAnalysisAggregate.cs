/// The <c>WfiWordform</c>'s own GUID, as text. Stable across breakdown edits even though the analyses

/// on any analysis.
/// </param>
/// <param name="Form">
/// The wordform's surface text in the project's default vernacular writing system, for a human or a link
/// to read — never part of any identity comparison. ADR 0038 decision 3's standing caveat applies: a
/// corrected spelling repoints occurrences at a <i>different</i> word form and may delete this one, so
/// watching <c>Form</c> across two responses would miss the ordinary case. Comparisons in this codebase
/// key on <see cref="WordformGuid"/> for exactly that reason.

/// The set of human-approved analyses — ADR 0038 decision 2's "durable test". A <i>set</i>, deliberately:
/// a genuinely ambiguous word form carries more than one correct reading, and nothing here collapses them
/// to "the" analysis. Empty means no human has approved anything for this word form — decision 7's "no
/// expectation", not a failing test.

/// The parser's analyses for this word form, resolved from a <see cref="StoredAssessment"/> the caller
/// already had — reading this record <b>never runs the parser itself</b> (ADR 0038 decision 5). Three
/// states, not two: <c>null</c> means either no Assessment is on record at all, or one is on record but
/// did not cover this word form (so nothing is known either way); an empty list means the Assessment
/// covered this word and the parser produced nothing. Collapsing those two would silently misreport a
/// word nobody asked the parser about as a word the parser failed on.
