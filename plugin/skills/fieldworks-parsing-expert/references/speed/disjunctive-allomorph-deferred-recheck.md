# Allomorph precedence may be checked late

**Scope:** FieldWorks 9.3.11 Windows/WinForms, source tag `FieldWorks9.3.11`
(`96da794961d20d82d53719824f3049aa19572533`). Help: official FLEx 9.3 CHM,
`sillsdev/FwHelps` develop `d468f9ca501f421616f622965e674f5f4678c9ce`;
`markdown-export` unavailable. Model vocabulary: `SIL.LCModel 11.0.0-beta0182`.
Help is older than the source tag; source configuration resolves differences. No Avalonia UI claims.
Engine gotcha source check: `sillsdev/machine` at `b9e7db4435c325494bdb2c68ec569cadeb10df23`;
this is documentary engine evidence, not a claim that this revision ships in FLEx 9.3.11.

**Reach:** FLEx allomorph order and environments; HC final validity checks.

## Mechanism

Environment-based disjunctive blocking can depend on the final surface. HC may construct several allomorph paths before it can reject a later one because an earlier one was eligible. Correct exception order need not reduce early candidate work.

## Check and repair hypothesis

Keep specific alternatives before the elsewhere form. Measure attempted versus confirmed paths and compare one boundary-changing word before calling the order a performance optimization.

Record completed confirmed analyses, candidate/search counts, per-word time and caps on the same
content and machine. A budget exhaustion is inconclusive. Retain every required analysis–surface
pair; see [measurement procedure](../workflow/measuring.md).

The original identifies engine implementing files; complexity shapes are not live measurements
of an unseen project. F07 establishes the narrower released loader reach.
