# A circumfix should stay one morphological choice

**Scope:** FieldWorks 9.3.11 Windows/WinForms, source tag `FieldWorks9.3.11`
(`96da794961d20d82d53719824f3049aa19572533`). Help: official FLEx 9.3 CHM,
`sillsdev/FwHelps` develop `d468f9ca501f421616f622965e674f5f4678c9ce`;
`markdown-export` unavailable. Model vocabulary: `SIL.LCModel 11.0.0-beta0182`.
Help is older than the source tag; source configuration resolves differences. No Avalonia UI claims.
Engine gotcha source check: `sillsdev/machine` at `b9e7db4435c325494bdb2c68ec569cadeb10df23`;
this is documentary engine evidence, not a claim that this revision ships in FLEx 9.3.11.

**Symptoms:** wrong or missing readings, load failure, or silent constraint loss depending on the condition.
**Reach:** FLEx circumfix morph type/associated forms; do not invent an engine-only editor.

## Mechanism

A native HC circumfix process realizes both portions as one application. Two independent affixes in separate optional slots abandon that atomicity and can return half-realized words.

## Check and repair hypothesis

Determine whether this is one discontinuous morpheme or genuinely two independent affixes. Use the circumfix surface when it is one; pairwise constraints must be justified and tested if a different representation is required.

Test both portions together and each half alone with the same stem; compare the returned morpheme identity, not only the spelling.
