# A prohibition list excludes a whole combination

Help is older than the source tag; source configuration resolves differences. No Avalonia UI claims.

this is documentary engine evidence, not a claim that this revision ships in FLEx 9.3.11.

**Symptoms:** wrong or missing readings, load failure, or silent constraint loss depending on the condition.
**Reach:** FLEx Ad hoc Rules; morpheme and allomorph prohibitions have distinct targets.

## Mechanism

An ad hoc rule with one key and several other members excludes the key together with the complete other-member combination. It does not necessarily mean a separate exclusion between the key and each listed member. Adjacency further narrows the condition.

## Check and repair hypothesis

If the intent is pairwise exclusion, represent the separate pairs and check their adjacency scope. Confirm the entire target list resolved into the loaded rule.

Test key+first, key+second, and key+both; a conjunction should reject only the specified complete combination.
