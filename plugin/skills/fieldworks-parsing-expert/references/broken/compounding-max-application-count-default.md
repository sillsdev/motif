**Symptoms:** wrong or missing readings, load failure, or silent constraint loss depending on the condition.
**Reach:** Release-checked HCLoader behavior; no generic exocentric override is promised.

## Mechanism

HC compound rules default to one application per derivation. The released loader reads a GUID-keyed maxApps override for endocentric rules, while its exocentric construction does not apply that lookup. A three-part compound can therefore fail after a two-part one succeeds.

## Check and repair hypothesis

Inspect rule kind, count and loaded configuration. An endocentric analysis is appropriate only if its category behavior is true; do not relabel an exocentric pattern to evade a limit. Report the unsupported recursive case honestly.

Compare two-element and repeated three-element compounds with the same rule and named complete analysis.
