  .SYNOPSIS
  Proves that an edit changed only comments, by diffing against HEAD.

  .DESCRIPTION
  Requires every line a change ADDS and every line it REMOVES to be a comment or blank.

  The symmetry is the whole point, and it is what the obvious version of this check gets wrong.
  Asking only "is everything you WROTE a comment?" is answered trivially and correctly by a pure
  deletion, so an Edit whose `old_string` ran past the end of a comment block -- deleting the `using`
  block and two type definitions along with it -- passes that check while the file stops compiling.

  Anchor the end of an `old_string` on the last comment line, never on the code that follows it. If a
  file does trip this verifier, `git checkout -- <file>` and redo the edit in smaller pieces rather
  than patching the wreckage.

  Two things this cannot do, so do not read a green result as more than it is. It is a diff-shape
  check, not a semantic one: it cannot tell a good comment from a bad one (that is
  comment-hygiene.cs), and it cannot tell that a deleted comment should have been kept. What it does
  tell you, with no compiler and in under a second, is that the code is untouched.

  .PARAMETER Path
  Files to verify. Omit to verify every modified file in the working tree.

  .EXAMPLE
  tools\verify-comment-only.ps1
  Verify every file modified against HEAD.

  .EXAMPLE
  tools\verify-comment-only.ps1 src\SIL.Motif.Generator\Program.cs
  Verify one file.
