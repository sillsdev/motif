  .SYNOPSIS
  Counts comment-hygiene violations in this repo's C#, PowerShell and MSBuild files, and fails if any remain.

  .DESCRIPTION
  ZERO TOLERANCE. Every violation is reported and every one is meant to go; there is no accepted
  count and no baseline file. A baseline records the CURRENT count as acceptable, and re-baselining
  after a rule change quietly relabels old debt as the new normal.

  Rules are stated in .claude/skills/code-comments/SKILL.md. Summary: a comment explains why; code
  says what, git says when, the plan and the issue register say where the project is. Project state
  in a source comment is true when written and unchecked forever after.

  The categories divide into two families.

  LINE-LEVEL (plan-reference, issue-reference, slice-status, date-in-comment, history-prose,
  attribution) score a single comment line against a regex. These catch project state: facts that
  were true when typed and are never checked again.

  `impl-comment-too-long` counts a single over-WIDE line as well as a multi-line block. Measuring only
  line count rewards reflowing a paragraph onto one 400-character line, which reads worse than the
  block it replaced and satisfies nothing the rule is for. One line means one readable line.

  BLOCK-LEVEL (impl-comment-too-long, cross-reference-claim, docs-link-broken, dead-citation) score a
  run of consecutive comment lines. They exist because the line-level family cannot see a comment
  that is simply FALSE ABOUT BEHAVIOUR, which is a different and more expensive class. Length is not
  why such a comment rots -- a one-line false claim rots identically. What rots is an unverifiable
  CLAIM ABOUT ANOTHER CODE ENTITY.

  A claim is answered by a `pinned by` test citation, and only by that. An earlier version also
  accepted a `docs/*.md` the block quoted, on the reasoning that rewording a quotation to dodge a
  claim verb would falsify it. That is true, and it is still not a licence: api-doc-defers-offline
  now bans those paths from API docs outright, so the two rules contradicted each other. Where a
  block quotes a contract, cite the test that settles the claim and quote on.

  API DOC COMPLETENESS (api-doc-defers-offline) is the third family, and it has one rule: an API doc
  says what it means or cites a URL anyone can open. A repo-relative Markdown path resolves only inside
  a checkout, so it is unreadable from an IDE tooltip or the compiled XML docs -- the two places an API
  doc is actually read. Cite an ADR by number, name a contract in prose, and inline the fact. The rule
  is about the reader's position, not about which top directory the path starts in, so `manifest/...`
  and `docs/...` are treated alike.

  STRING LITERALS are the fourth family. An exception message is read further from the code than any
  comment -- by someone holding only the message -- so a plan or issue reference rots there at least as
  badly. Code lines are therefore scanned for the two DISTINCTIVE patterns only, and only in C#:

    - not the bare register ID, because one uppercase letter and a digit matches ordinary identifiers
      wherever it is not surrounded by prose;
    - not in PowerShell, because this script quotes the patterns and would report its own definitions.

  A repo-relative Markdown path is NOT banned from a message string. The two bans have different
  reasons: an issue reference rots, while a `docs/...md` path is merely unopenable from a tooltip. The
  reader of a generator's exception is standing in a checkout, so a path helps them.

  PROJECT FILES are the fifth family. `.csproj`, `.props` and `.targets` are committed source that
  people read, and an `<!-- -->` block in one rots exactly like a `//` block does. Only the LINE-LEVEL
  family applies there:

    - not the length rule, because an XML comment is neither a `//` nor an API doc, and MSBuild files
      legitimately carry longer explanatory blocks;
    - not api-doc-defers-offline, because nobody reads a `.csproj` comment in a tooltip, so a
      `docs/...md` path is openable by its reader -- the same distinction STRING LITERALS draws above.

  A project file is scanned whole-file rather than line-by-line, because `<!-- -->` can span lines and
  can share a line with markup; each physical line inside a comment block is still scored on its own,
  the same as a `//` or `#` line elsewhere. It is never scanned for literals: this script is itself a
  `.ps1`, never a `.csproj`, so the self-reference problem the bullet above solves for PowerShell does
  not even arise here.

  The C# port differs from PanGloss's Rust original in two ways that matter:

    - `<see cref="X"/>` is resolved by the C# compiler (CS1574), so code-to-code references are NOT
      banned here. Rust's intra-doc links rot unobserved; C#'s do not. A cref still proves only that
      the name resolves, never that the sentence is true.
    - The interface/implementation split is `///` on a public or internal member (long form allowed)
      versus `//` anywhere and `///` on a private member (one line).

  Generated `*.g.cs` files are excluded: they are template output, and the fix for a bad comment in
  one is a fix to the emitter. The emitters ARE scanned, and a `//` line inside a raw-string template
  is scanned by the LINE-LEVEL family, because a plan reference written into a template still ships
  in a committed file. It is exempt from the BLOCK-LEVEL length rule: what that block measures is the
  generated file's `<auto-generated>` banner, which is length-exempt like the rest of the file it
  lands in. Measuring it against the emitter's own comment budget is a category error.

  Length is the only thing a template escapes. A `///` line inside one is checked for API-doc
  completeness on its own, because the file it lands in is public surface and its reader is looking at
  a tooltip like any other. That check is per line rather than per block: the block machinery is what
  the template exemption switches off.

  `spikes/` is scanned on the same terms as `src/` and `tests/`. It is committed C# that the test
  project compiles against, so a comment there is read exactly like one anywhere else. Exempting a
  directory is a baseline wearing a different hat.

  Both of those needed the same thing, and `Split-CSharpLine` is it: one pass per line that tracks
  string, verbatim-string and char-literal state, so a `//` is known to be a comment rather than the
  middle of a URL. It answers two questions at once.

    - A TRAILING comment -- one sharing a line with code -- is scanned by the line-level family, and
      for width. It is one line by construction, so width is the only length question left.
    - COMMENT TEXT ASSEMBLED IN A LITERAL, the `$"/// ..."` an emitter writes, is scanned as what it
      becomes. Plan and issue references are skipped there only because the literal families already
      cover them, and reporting twice for one line helps nobody.

  What remains genuinely uncheckable is the interpolated VALUE: `$"/// {summary}"` can carry anything
  at run time, and no static pass will see it. That is a smaller claim than the one it replaces --
  the literal parts around the hole are now read.
